## Notes and timestamps

13:54 Introduction to events video

- EVM can emit logs
- EVM writes to a log - can then read these logs
- Events allow you to print to the logging structure
- Smart contracts can't access logs
- `indexed` parameters = topics
- much easier to search for and query
- `emit` an event

14:03 Chainlink VRF

14:14 Hardhat shorthand

- `yarn global add hardhat-shorthand`
- e.g. can now run `hh compile` instead of `yarn hardhat compile`
- NOTE - couldn't get this working so moving on without using shorthand
